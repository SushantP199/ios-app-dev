/*
    Writinhg hello world is one of the easiest of the program but whole
    point to writing this we can verify that we have workable environment
    where we can write some code. It also give basic overview about the
    language that how syntax looks like and we can move ahead in that.
  
 
    As while writing & compiling this program I got couple errors related
    to configurations and I fixed that configuaration successfully. And
    now able to write and execute this program properly, which indicates
    yes I have now workable environment and I can proceed my futher
    development journey without any hesitation.
