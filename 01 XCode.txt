XCode :-

 In order to build any kind of apps in the app store that is going to required an xcode.

 Whether your is app going into you apple device may be an iphone, may be an apple watch,
 may be an apple tv all goes through xcode

 That is one of the beauty about ios or apple ecosystem that you don't require too much
 ton of assets (we just need xcode to work on well).

 We just require some assets in terms of images, icons, audio etc.

 Xcode is such a big software it is a not only place where we write the code but also
 is a place we test our code. It actually comes with simulators of apple devices iPhones,
 iPads and it even installs some of the command line tools but the good thing is you 
 don't require any hardware devices for the majority of the apps and we can also work on
 testing the multiple devices like iPhone 12 or iPhone 13 etc.
