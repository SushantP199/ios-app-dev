* How The Historically iOS Development Evolved ?

- Previously we used to write everything in Objective-C, which is not one of the most friendliest of the language
  but it was very consistent and thats why a lot of people moved into the version or era of writing iOS app
  with Objective-C.

- Things got actually changed and evolved as soon as Swift is introduced.

- Swift is a compiled language.
  Hence it is very Performant and Optimized language (for apple devices).

- Apple doesn't introduced a Swift directly. It was a very smooth transition.
  All developers who writing Objective-C code can use Objective-C in Swift in
  earlier days. But now onwards everything is moving into Swift direction.

- In 2014, Swift first version was lanunched Swift 1.0 XCode6.
  
- As there some issues like lack of try catch in first version,
  Thereafter in 2015, Swift 2.2 released which was Open Source.

- Then in 2019, the most polished version Swift 5 was released which is also Open Source.

- And in 2021, Swift 5.5 Open Source was released.

- Apart from it Swift 5.6 to be released in 2022.
