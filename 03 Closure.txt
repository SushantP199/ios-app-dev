* What is Closure ?

- Closure is simply a function without name (of course without func keyword too).

- Closure can be thrown around in any variable.

- Closure is a refernce type. (Whenever you assign a function or a closure to a 
  constant or a variable, you are actually setting that constant or variable to 
  be a reference to the function or closure)

- Closure is more likey used in app building a lot of times.

- Usually, closure execute the moment we call somewhere in code.
  But there are some situations we don't want this to happen,
  specially when we are talking to internet, suppose there is a data url
  where we are downloading image and passing some methods onto that and in 
  those cases we want to execute our closure when image is being downloaded
  from the web.
  (note : refer dataTask function in file Playground/14 Closures)


* Why we don't write var or let keyword in paramters variable 
  declaration of Closure or Function  ?

- In swift functions are designed in way where, function parameters 
  are by default constant (i.e. implicitly defined with let keyword), 
  we no need to write let explicitly. 

- And as paramters by default constant there in no point or 
  concern of discussing var keyword.
