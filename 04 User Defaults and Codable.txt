* What is User Defaults ?

- Whenever we are going to make any app in which we want to store some data (to store user preferences)
  or want to retrieve some data, edit the data. Now this data can go into the user defaults.

- For example, when we select dark mode for any application, 
  this data (says that selected mode is dark one now) is stored into user defaults.

- Every application behaves it is own sandbox i.e. its store some of its own (app) information
  and it doesn't really pollute anything outside of it i.e. doesn't store anything outside of app
  environment. This storage or database in app environement is called as User Defaults.


* What is Codable ?

- Protocol which simply converts (either encodes or decodes) the data into the required type.

- Codable is the combined protocol of Swift's Decodable and Encodable protocols. Together they
  provide standard methods of decoding data for custom types and encoding data to be saved or transferred.
