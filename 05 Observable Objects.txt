* What are Observable Objects and Published? 

- When any class follows a protocol of Observable Objects and we marks some of properties of
  that class as published, then that properties are observable i.e. we can observe that properties
  and any change in them (properties) will automatically tells the swiftui that we need to 
  repopulate or reupdate the UI.

* State Management in SwiftUI :-

1) State 
2) Binding
3) ObservableObject with Published and ObservedObject
4) EnvironmentObject
