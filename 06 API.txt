* What is API ?

- The way these days applications are being designed, there is a stand alone backend and that
  backend can talk to your android app, to your iOS app, to you website. So the whole idea is 
  to create centralized backend which can just throw the APIs and (front-end) developers can 
  handle those APIs.

- Handling APIs is one of the most key important aspect of developer who is building iOS app,
  android app or any thing else (front-end).

- APIs is a simple of talking to your database or talking to your backend for frontend.
